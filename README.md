Chewbotcca is a discord bot written in discordrb.

The help server is available here: ![Discord](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/200388197396512768/widget.png)

Command list can be found on the wiki. Still working on it though.

I will update this as we get along, but currently Chewbotcca is really lame. I'm learning though stay with me.

Add the bot to your server with: http://chcra.site/Chewbotcca

## Poorly Written Installation Guide

I'd rather you not run your own instance of Chewbotcca, just add the bot to your server, but if you insist...

1) Download all files from github

2) Put a bot token in the token slot (lol) in the example.config.yaml and save as config.yaml

3) Go into the actual bot and change client ID to whatever, go through all owner ids and make them yours (if you want)

4) run bot with ruby
