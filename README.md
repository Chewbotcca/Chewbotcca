Chewbotcca is a discord bot written in discordrb.

The help server is available here: ![Discord](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/200388197396512768/widget.png)

Command list can be found with `%^help`, use `%^info command` to find more info.

I will update this as we get along, but currently Chewbotcca is really lame. I'm learning though stay with me.

Add the bot to your server with: http://bit.ly/Chewbotcca

## Poorly Written Installation Guide

I'd rather you not run your own instance of Chewbotcca, just add the bot to your server, but if you insist...

1) Download all files from github

2) Head on over to the code.rb and put in the token and client id.

3) Be sure you have discordrb, rest-client, and json gems installed.

4) run bot with ruby

Something didn't work? Cool beans.
